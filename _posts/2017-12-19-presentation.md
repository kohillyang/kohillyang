Dear ben, What I'll share with you today is the robot contest when I'm in DJI's campus. It's a amazing experience and I wish you like it.

First, There's some information of the contest called Robomaster, as the name says, it's a robot contest and its main roles are not humans but robots. What's more, they are robots which can work automatically, which means they can find ways, detect obstacles by themselves, and they can even detect enemy and attack ememy automatically. For each game, there are tow group, and each group owns a car we called archer and a quarotor I called rider. because a archer can attach from very long distance and a rider can fly with his ride can fly.


For each car, there's a blood bar whose blood will minus one if the car hit by bullet, so, if the blood come to zero, then the car's power will be cut by judge system. Each car has a camera a radar, it's the eyes of the car, camera are used to find enemy and radar is used to detect abstacles. So, the radar is fixed but the camera can rotate with the gnu barrel. So, there's a control system which can control the gnu barrel rotate letting the camera can track the enemy.
For example ,the enemy walks from here to there, them the camera will rotate from here to there, and shoot the enemy. There's also a system that control the motor's rotating speed, 


Now , we have these background knowledge, and in the two days before the contest day, we almost achieve the goal, which means that the car and the quadrotor can move automatically. but, unfortually, in the night before the contest day, there's something wrong with this system, the car can't move, and we can't fix it. And even worse, in the morning of the contest day, we find the car's gnu can hardly shoot, which means that, sometimes it can shoot, and sometimes it can't shoot.


We didn't give the car up. But the contest comming, in the first game with group 6, we lost, but my teamates are very smart, they found the enemy's car can only walk along a fixed way, and We found a place where they can't find our car, At last , The enemy can't find us, but we can see him, and fortunatelly, the gnu worked ,and the camera worked too, so we begin to shoot, and we beat group 6.


When we play with group 7, we become more lucky ,we found the enemy's camera can be attracked by strong light, So we place a car in the rightmost place, where there's a light. So even our gun became more worse, one bullet hit the enemy, and we beat group 7 too.


So, there's my summary, and there's hope even the situation is very worse, this is what i learned form the experience.
