WHEN an asteroid hit Earth 66m years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75% of plant and animal species, it hurt Mexico first. Donald Trump’s inauguration is far less frightening, but Mexicans can talk of little else.<br>

Outside a massive Volkswagen (VW) factory in Puebla, two hours’ drive from Mexico City, workers fret about Mr Trump’s threats to whack big tariffs on cars made in Mexico. One American carmaker—Ford—cancelled plans to build a $1.6bn plant in San Luis Potosí, some five hours farther north. It may have had other reasons for doing so, but workers in Puebla are not reassured.<br>

“We’re frustrated,” says Ricardo Méndez, an equipment repairman who works for one of VW’s suppliers. He had expected his employer to send him to work at the new Ford plant. Between bites of spicy chicken taco, Santiago Nuñez, who works for another VW supplier, vows to boycott the American carmaker.<br>

The anger and bewilderment in Puebla is felt across Mexico. Mr Trump’s promises to make Mexico pay for a border wall, deport millions of illegal immigrants and rip up the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were among the few consistent policies in his largely substance-free election campaign. He has not lost his taste for Mexico-bashing. In a press conference on January 11th, his first since July, Mr Trump repeated his claim that Mexico is “taking advantage” of the United States. Mexicans can only wait and wonder how he intends to act on that misguided notion.<br>

The Trump presidency streaking toward Mexico is already causing problems. Inflation has started rising in response to the devaluation of the peso caused by his election. The central bank raised interest rates five times in 2016; it will probably have to continue tightening. After a sharp rise in public debt as a share of GDP over the past several years, the government must curb spending.<br>

Over the past few months economists have lowered their forecasts for GDP growth in 2017, from an average of 2.3% to 1.4%. On January 1st the government cut a popular subsidy by raising petrol prices by up to 20%. Six people died in the ensuing protests.<br>

If Mr Trump declares economic war, things could get much worse. The economy could stumble into recession, just as Mexico is preparing for a presidential election in 2018. Mr Trump’s pugilism increases the chances that Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-wing populist, will win. He would probably counter American protectionism with the sort of self-destructive economic nationalism to which Mexico has disastrously resorted in the past. Vital reforms of energy, telecoms and education, enacted under Mexico’s current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, might be reversed.<br>

Mexican officials think the Trump presidency poses two main dangers. The first is that the United States will renounce NAFTA, which it can do after six months’ notice, or simply shred it by putting up trade barriers. The second is that, as a way of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr Trump will carry out his threat to block remittances from immigrants in the United States. These inject some $25bn a year into Mexico’s economy.<br>

The president-elect’s other big anti-Mexican idea, to dump millions of illegal immigrants on Mexico’s northern border, is seen as a lesser threat. Under Barack Obama, the United States deported some 175,000 Mexicans a year; Mr Trump will find it hard to increase that number. Republican plans to tax imports as part of a reform of corporate income tax would hit Mexico hard. The government sees that as a problem to be addressed by the United States’ trading partners in concert, rather than by Mexico alone.<br>

It’s Donald. Duck!<br>

Mr Peña’s instinct is to act as if Mr Trump is more reasonable than he seems. He showed his conciliatory side when he invited Mr Trump to Mexico City in August during the election campaign. The ersatz summit, at which Mr Peña failed to tell Mr Trump publicly that Mexico would not pay for his wall, so enraged Mexicans that Luis Videgaray, the finance minister who had suggested the meeting, was forced to quit. Now Mr Peña has brought him back, as foreign minister. But his tone has become tougher. Mr Peña now rejects Mr Trump’s attempts to influence investment “on the basis of fear or threats”.<br>

To some, the rehiring of Mr Videgaray looks like a smart move. He is thought to be friendly with Jared Kushner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law, who is to become an adviser in the White House (on trade, among other things). Mr Trump himself praised Mr Videgaray after his sacking as a “brilliant finance minister and wonderful man”.<br>

But Mexicans regard him with disdain. In turning to a member of his inner circle to manage Mexico’s relationship with the United States, Mr Peña missed a chance to hire someone with fresh ideas. Mr Videgaray “can have lunch at the White House”, notes Shannon O’Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, but she worries that his focus “will just be on the Oval Office”. To press its case that the United States has more to gain from working with Mexico than from walloping it, the government must talk to congressmen, state politicians and business leaders. It should also mobilise the 35m people of Mexican origin living in the United States.<br>

Mexico thinks it has killer arguments for building on the partnership rather than destroying it. Some 5m American jobs depend on trade with Mexico; when Mexico ships goods north, 40% of their value comes from inputs bought from the United States. Officials hope that the new administration will opt for the fluffiest versions of Trumpism. Instead of repealing NAFTA, perhaps Mr Trump will renegotiate it, incorporating new standards for protecting intellectual property and the environment. Another tactic under consideration is to boost imports from Mexico’s NAFTA partners. The thinking is that reducing Mexico’s trade surplus with the United States, about $59bn last year, would give Mr Trump a victory he could sell to his protectionist supporters.<br>

If conciliation fails, Mexico has few attractive options. In a trade war, it would suffer horribly. Raising its own tariffs would hurt its own consumers. Yet that does not mean that Mexico is defenceless. In 2009 it imposed tariffs on nearly 100 American products, including strawberries and Christmas trees, after the United States barred Mexican lorries from its roads to protect the jobs of American drivers. That got the attention of American politicians: the pro-trade lobby prevailed.<br>

Mexican analysts are thinking about how the country might fight the next skirmish. Maize, grown mainly in states that voted for Mr Trump, will be a tempting target. The United States sold about $2.5bn-worth to Mexico in 2016. Faced with the loss of their biggest market, American maize farmers might press the White House to relent. On January 6th 16 American farming groups warned in a letter to Mr Trump and Mike Pence, the vice-president-elect, that disrupting trade with Mexico and other countries would have “devastating consequences” for farmers, who are already suffering from low prices.<br>

For now, Mexicans are praying that Mr Trump will prove more temperate in office than during his meteoric rise. There is little evidence that will happen.

<div style="text-align:center">特朗普准备攻打墨西哥（WHAT?）  </div>
<div style="text-align:center">由于贸易保护主义者进入了白宫，墨西哥不得不考虑它所拥有的选择 </div>
<div>
　　大概在6.6亿年前，一个小行星撞击了地球，清扫了地球上的恐龙以及75%的植物和物种，这场灾难的首先受害者是墨西哥。特朗普的就职演说一点也不让人害怕，甚至对于墨西哥人来说还可以谈论一些别的。<br>
　　在距离墨西哥大约两小时车程的普埃布拉（Puebla，墨西哥中部的一个城市）的一个巨大的大众汽车公司的工厂外，工作人民对特朗普的对墨西哥生产的汽车征收高额关税的威胁十分担心。一个美国生产公司——福特取消了在距离北部只有数十个小时的墨西哥城市San Luis Potosí修建一个预计耗资16亿美元的计划。也许他们这样做有别的原因，但是这并不能让工人们安心。<br>
　　“我们感到十分沮丧”，为大众汽车（简称VW）的一家供应商工作的一个装备维修工说。<!-- 这里plant还有公司的意思-->。他曾经期望他的上司能把他送到新工厂上班。在厨房的玉米卷的辛辣刺激中工作的为另一个大众供应商工作的工人Santiago Nuñez发誓要抵制美国汽车工厂。<br>
　　Puebla愤怒和困惑的情绪在整个墨西哥普遍存在。特朗普作出的在墨西哥和美国的边界造一堵墙，将数百万的非法移民遣送回国，以及撕毁美国自由贸易协议的承诺是在他之前的免费选举竞赛中为数不多不多的始终如一的政策。他还没有对对墨西哥的抨击失去兴趣。在一月11日的新闻发布会上(press conference)，特朗普重申自六月以来的观点————墨西哥在利用美国。墨西哥人只能等待并且揣测特朗普究竟如何将他的近乎荒唐的观点付诸实际行动。<br>
　　特朗普总统对墨西哥的政策（straking toward Mexico）已经正在造成一些问题。比如由于他的选举造成的比索币（peso）贬值带来的通货膨胀，在2016年中央银行6次调高了利率；并且似乎会持续紧张（这里的it代指什么并不清楚……）。在过去的数年里作为GDP的一部分的公共债务的急剧增长之后，政府必须控制开支。<br>
   在过去的几个月里经济学家下调了GDP的增长————从平均2.3%调到了1.4%。一月一日政府通过上调汽油20%的价格裁掉了一项受众面比较广泛的津贴。在接下来的保护运动中有六个人死亡。<br>
　　如果特朗普要挑起经济战争，那么事情将会变得更加糟糕。经济将会陷入低迷，因为墨西哥正在准备2018年的总统选举。特朗普的搏击将会增加民主党派代表Andrés Manuel Lópe Obrador在选举中胜出的机会。他或许会用那种这墨西哥曾经使用过的自我毁灭的种族主义来还击美国保护主义。Enrique Peña Nieto领导下的巨大的能源改革，通信，教育等都可能朝着相反方向进行。<br>
　　墨西哥官方认为特朗普总统引起了至少两个主要的危险。首先是美国会放弃NAFTA，美国可以以6个月之后发布一个通知的形式，或者仅仅是以设置贸易障碍的方式单方面撕毁协议。其次美国为了让墨西哥支付修墙的费用，特朗普可能以冻结墨西哥移民的汇款的方式威胁墨西哥，而这些汇款将会每年大约向墨西哥的经济注入大约250亿美元。
　　相对来说，选举中的其他主要反墨点子，比如要把来自墨西哥的数百万非法移民赶出美国边界，似乎威胁小很多。在Obama的领导下的美国每年会遣送大约17500墨西哥人回国。特朗普会发现增加这项数字非常困难。共和党计划对进口的东西征收作为公司所得税地一部分的税收或许会沉重地打击墨西哥。政府（哪个政府啊……）看到了这个在会议上被美国贸易伙伴而不是墨西哥一个国家定位地问题。<br></div>
<div style="color:red">　　它是康纳德（It’s Donald. Duck!）！</div><br>
　　Peña的本意是认为特朗普比他看起来的那样更为理性，当他邀请在八月选举竞赛的时候邀请特朗普到墨西哥城市他表现了他安抚的一面。在首脑峰会上，Peña并没有成功地告诉特朗普墨西哥并不会为那堵墙付钱，因此暴怒地墨西哥人Luis Videgaray,提出这场峰会的墨西哥的财政部部长被迫辞职。而现在Peña重新启用了Luis Videgaray作为外交部部长。但是他的态度已经变得更加强硬了，这从Peña拒绝了Trump的改变害怕以及威胁的基础的尝试可以看出。<br>
　　从某种意义上来说，雇佣Videgaray 似乎是一个非常明智的举措。他被认为比在白宫当关于贸易以及其他方面的adviser的特朗普的养子Jared Kushner更为友好。特朗普本人在Videgaray 解雇后赞赏Videgaray是一个非常聪明的财政部部长，也是一个非常厉害的男人。<br>
