## 原文
IT MIGHT be called May’s paradox. Since she became prime minister last July, Mrs May has been urged by businesses to clarify her Brexit goals. Yet every time she has tried, investors have reacted by selling sterling, because she has shown a preference for a “hard” (or, as her advisers prefer, “clean”) Brexit that takes Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union. <br>

In fact the pound rose on January 17th when she gave a speech that set out her most detailed thinking so far about Brexit. That was partly because her decision to leave the single market and customs union had been widely trailed, causing the pound to fall in the run-up to her speech. But it may also have been because markets were pleasantly surprised by her language in setting out a dream of a liberal, open future for the country—she spoke behind the slogan “A Global Britain”—and her expressed wish for continuing friendly relations with Europe.<br>

There is a liberal vision of a post-Brexit future in which Britain escapes the most protectionist features of the EU and opens its economy to the rest of the world. It is one that includes lower taxes, less pettifogging regulation and freer trade. During the referendum campaign it was sometimes talked of as “Singapore on steroids”: a dynamic, open Britain capable of competing not just with other EU countries but with the whole world.<br>

## 译文

　　这也许就是个悖论。自从MAY在去年的七月份成为英国首相以来，她一直被商业公司（businesses）请求澄清她的脱欧目标。然而每次她尝试（澄清的时候），投资者都会以卖掉手中的英国货币来作出反应，因为她之前脱离欧盟单一市场以及关税联盟(customs union)的言论表现出了硬退欧地倾向（或者她的智能团所说的干净地退欧）。<br>
　　事实上一月17日在她发表了目前对英国退欧详细的想法之后英镑升值了。而其中一部分原因就是她的退出单一市场和关税联盟的决定被广受关注，该决定曾导致在演讲之前英镑贬值。但是也许也是因为市场对她自由，开放的国家的梦想的惊讶——她在标语“A Global Britain”之后发表的演讲，并且她表现了与欧盟继续友好的关系的希望。<br>
　　关于英国退欧以及英国逃脱了欧盟贸易保护的特点以及英国对全世界开放它的经济之后的将来有一个自由版本。它拥有更低的税务，更少的骗人的监管（less pettifogging regulation）以及更自由的贸易。在公投运动总有时（这种版本）被认为就像是新加坡的类固醇(Singapore on steroids)的一种动态的，开放的英国与全世界国家竞争的而不是与其他欧盟国家竞争的英国能力。<br>
