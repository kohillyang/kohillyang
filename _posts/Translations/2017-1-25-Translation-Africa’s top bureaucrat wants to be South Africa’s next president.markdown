## 原文

　IN MANY ways the African Union (AU) is outdoing its European counterpart. It has never presided over a continental currency crisis. No member state is threatening to quit. And you could walk from Cairo to Cape Town without meeting anyone who complains about the overweening bossiness of the African superstate. But this is largely because the AU, unlike the EU, is irrelevant to most people’s lives. That is a pity.<br>

　Before 2002, when it was called the Organisation of African Unity, it was dismissed as a talking-shop for dictators. For the next decade, it was led by diplomats from small countries, picked by member states precisely because they had so little clout. But then, in 2012, a heavyweight stepped in to run the AU commission. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran of the anti-apartheid struggle and a woman who had held three important cabinet posts in South Africa, was expected to inject more vigour and ambition into the AU. As she prepares to hand over to an as-yet unnamed successor this month, it is worth assessing her record (see article).<br>

　This matters for two reasons. First, because Africa’s forum for tackling regional problems needs to work better. Second, because Ms Dlamini-Zuma apparently wants to be the next president of South Africa. Her experience at the AU, supporters claim, makes her the best-qualified successor to President Jacob Zuma, who happens to be her ex-husband.<br>

　Running the ill-funded AU is hard, but even so, nothing she has achieved there suggests that she deserves to run her country. Her flagship policy, Agenda 2063, is like a balloon ride over the Serengeti, offering pleasant views of a distant horizon and powered by hot air. By 2063, when none of its boosters will still be in power, it hopes that Africa will be rich, peaceful, corruption-free and enjoying the benefits of “transformative leadership in all fields”. In the shorter term, Ms Dlamini-Zuma has called for a shared currency, a central bank and a “continental government” to tie together states that barely trade with one another. None of this is happening. She also wants to introduce a single African passport letting citizens move freely across the continent by 2018. A splendid idea, but for now the AU issues them only to heads of state and senior AU officials.<br>

## 译文

　　从很多方面来讲非洲联盟（AU，下文简称非盟）都比他的伙伴欧盟强。非盟从未发生过**欧洲那样的(continental)**货币危机，也没有成员国威胁说要退出。如果你从Cairo 走到Cape Town，你不会遇到任何一个抱怨**非洲霸权主义国家（overweening bossiness of the African superstat）**的人。但这很大一部分程度上是因为非盟，不像欧盟，非常遗憾的是，跟大多数人的生活无关，<br>
　　2002年之前，当AU被称作欧洲联盟统一组织的时候，它经常被独裁者当做空谈忽视掉(dismissed as a talking-shop)。在接下来的十年里，它被来自小国家的外交官领导，这些国家被成员国精心挑选，因为他们没啥影响力。但是接下来，在2012，非洲委员会跨出了一大步。Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma，一个在反种族歧视战争有着十分丰富的经验的老兵，希望往非盟中注入更多活力与野心，因为它准备这个月作为一个**匿名的未成功者卸任（hand over to an as-yet unamed successor.）**，所以评价一下她的记录是十分有价值的。<br>
　　这个主要是两方面原因，首先，非洲论坛的处理地区问题的效率不高。其次，因为偶然成为她的丈夫的Dlamini-Zuma显然十分想成为下一个南非的领导人。<br>
　　经营财政困难的AU非常艰难，但是即便如此，**她所做的任何事都不能证明值得由她来经营她的国家（nothing she has achieved there suggests that she deserves to run her country）**。她的旗舰政策（flagship），即议程2063，就像是用热空气提供动力的气球，飞跃了Serengeti，并提供了非常舒服的远距离的视野。该政策希望非洲富裕，和平，没有贪污并且在所有领域能享受“弹性领导力”（transformative leadership of all fields）的好处.在短期，Dlamini-Zuma 提倡通用货币，一个中央银行以及一个大陆政府来将几乎没有贸易往来的各国紧紧地联系在一起。然而所有的这些都没有发生。她还希望引进一个单一护照以使得各国的居民能实现在2018年之前能自由出入别国的目标。这是一个非常好的想法，但是目前AU只面向各国首脑以及AU高级官员发行了通用护照。<br>
