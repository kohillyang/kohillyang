　After hard, soft and then red, white and blue, Theresa May announced a “clean” Brexit. In her most important speech yet on the issue, <strong>Britain</strong>’s prime minister set out a position for quitting the EU that includes leaving the single market and customs union. Mrs May said she would seekthe best possible trade terms with Europe and be a “good neighbour”, but that no deal would be better than a bad deal for Britain. Donald Trump held out the promise of a trade agreement with America after praising Britain's Brexit choice.<br>
　　在各种纠结之后，Theresa May 终于宣布了净身退欧。在MAY已经发表的最重要的演讲中，英国的领导人将退欧定位，包括退出单一市场以及关税联盟。MAY说她会找一种最好的可能的方式与欧洲交易并做一个好邻居，但是事实上对于英国来说没有交易要比一个不好的交易更好。在英国做出了退欧的决定之后特朗普作出了与美国可以达成贸易协议的允诺。<br><br>

　Germany’s chancellor,Angela Merkel, responded to Mrs May’s <strong>Brexit</strong> speech with vows to hold the EU together and blockany British “cherrypicking” in the negotiations. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president ofthe European Commission, promised to work　for a fair deal for both sides, saying: “We are not in a hostile mood.”<br>
　　德国的总理，Angela Merkel，对MAY的演讲回应称，德国将坚决维护欧盟的完整，对英国猴子掰包谷的想法都应该扼杀在谈判之中。而欧盟委员会的领导人Jean-Claude Juncker则承诺会致力于公平交易，他说：“我们并没有处在敌对情绪之中”。<br><br>

<strong>　Northern Ireland’s</strong> Assembly collapsed amid a scandal involving the first minister’s handling of a renewable heating programme that could cost taxpayers £490m ($600m). Elections for a new Assembly on March 2nd might come to be used as a proxy poll on Brexit: the province voted to remain in the EU.  <br>
　北爱尔兰议会似乎陷入了第一领导人的可再生能源供热的项目的丑闻之中，该项目可能会花掉纳税人的大概6亿美元的钱。而3月2日的新议会的选举也许会成为一个关于英国脱欧的投票，因为北爱尔兰想要留在欧盟。 <br><br>
<strong>　The European Parliament</strong> elected a new president. Antonio Tajani, an Italian conservative from the European People’s Party, will replace Germany’s Martin Schulz. Under his leadership, the parliament will have the final say on approving Brexit. <br>
　　欧洲议会之前选出了一位新领导人，名叫Antonio Tajani。他是一个来自欧洲民主党的意大利的保守主义者，将会替代德国人Martin Schulz的位置。在他的领导下，议会将拥有是否支持英国退欧的最终决定权。<br>
<br>
　An avalanche hit a hotel in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. Around 30 people were inside. The avalanche was apparently triggered by one of three earthquakes that struck the region this week. Earthquakes in the same area last year killed more than 300 people.  <br>
　在意大利中部的Abruzzo地区的一个旅馆遭受了一次雪崩的撞击。大概有30人被困。这次雪崩显然是由这周发生在这个地区的三次地震引起的。而在当地去年有超过300人在地震中丧生。<br><br>
<strong>　Germany’s</strong> federal court rejected an attempt to ban the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party. German states submitted a petition to ban it in 2013, citing its racist, anti-Semitic platform. The court found that although the party “pursues aims contrary to the constitution”, it does not pose a threat to democracy.<br>
　德国的联邦法庭拒绝了禁止新纳粹国际人民协会的活动的尝试。德国在2013年提交了禁止它的请愿书。请愿书中叙述了它的种族歧视，以及反犹太人的平台。法庭调查发现，该协会尽管有悖于宪法，但是它并没有形成对民主的威胁。<br><br><br><br>

　In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, defended globalisation and said trade wars produced no winners.

See [article](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21715035-does-he-really-want-be-global-leader-xi-jinping-portrays-china-rock-stability). <br>

　Australia, China and Malaysia abandoned the search for MH370, a Malaysian airliner that disappeared in the southern Indian Ocean in 2014 with 239 people on board. Debris from the plane has washed up in Africa, but the crash site has never been located.<br>

　Barack Obama ended the 22-year-old “wet foot, dry foot” policy, under which Cubans who landed on American soil were permitted to stay.

　　奥巴马结束了22年的“湿脚，干脚”的针对居住在美国的古巴人的政策，之前他们被允许留在美国，而他们现在如果尝试进入美国的话他们会享受与其他国家的移民相同的“待遇”。奥巴马的决定旨在维护与古巴共产主义政府的正常关系。<br><br>

　Having lost an election, Yahya Jammeh missed a deadline to step down as president of the <strong>Gambia</strong> to make way for his successor, Adama Barrow.

　　埃及的一个高级法庭支持了一项裁定，该裁定将阻止沙特政府对沙特阿拉伯旁边红海当中的两所岛屿的行使主权。该政府希望将两所政府归还给沙特，但这造成了去年的在埃及的一次游行。20世纪五十年代，埃及曾应沙特方要求代为保管这两所岛屿。<br><br>
<font color="red"><strong>Clemency for Chelsea</strong><br></font>
　In one of his final actions as president, Barack Obama commuted the sentence handed down to <strong>Chelsea Manning</strong>, a former intelligence analyst, for passing secret documents to WikiLeaks.
