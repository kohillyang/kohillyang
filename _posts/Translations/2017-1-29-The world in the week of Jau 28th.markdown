<p>Donald Trump started his term as America’s president. Surrounded by Washington’s power-brokers, Mr Trump’s inauguration speech was a remarkable populist attack on political elites, whom he lambasted for neglecting “struggling families”; he vowed to end “American carnage”. Americans, he said, would no longer “accept politicians who are all talk and no action”.</p>

　　特朗普开始了他的总统任期。被一群“权利破坏者(power-brokers)”包围，特朗普的演讲跟是一场引人注目的大众化的对政敌的攻击，他指责他的政敌忽视“正在挣扎的家庭”。他发誓结束“美国屠杀”。“美国”，特朗普说，“不再接受只说不做的政治家”。<br><br>

<p>Soon after being sworn into office Mr Trump signed a wide-ranging executive order allowing federal agencies to stop participating in any part of the Obamacare law they deem to be onerous, ahead of a forthcoming bill in Congress to rescind his predecessor’s signature policy. He also declared that America would not join the TPP trade deal and ordered work to start on building a wall along the Mexican border (but was hazy as to how it will be paid for).</p>

　　在宣誓就职后特朗普很快签署了一系列的行政命令来允许联邦机构停止参与奥巴马医改法案中任何他们认为繁琐的部分，这先于即将颁布的解除他的前任颁布的政策的国会法案。他还声明美国不会参加TPP并且让一些修建墨西哥边境之墙的工作开始进行。<br><br>

<p>Millions of people took to the streets in anti-Trump protests themed as “women’s marches” in America and dozens of other countries. The biggest demonstration was in Washington, DC, where an estimated half a million people thronged the capital. </p>

　　美国和数十个国家的数百万的人到街道参与以“女性游行（women's marthes）”为主题的的反特朗普游行中。最大的游行在华盛顿特区，在那儿估计有五十万的人拥挤在首都里。<br><br>

<p>The Senate moved swiftly to confirm some of Mr Trump’s appointments to federal jobs, including James Mattis as defence secretary and John Kelly as the head of homeland security. Rex Tillerson’s appointment as secretary of state was approved by the relevant committee. Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida who seemed to be opposed to Mr Tillerson, voted for him.</p>

　　为了确认特朗普对联邦职务的任命，参议院（的人员）正慢慢更新。包括任命James Mattis作为国防部部长，以及任命John Kelly作为负责国家安全的头儿。Rex Tillerson被任命为国务卿的决定也得到了相关委员会的支持。Marco Rubio之前似乎是反对Mr Tillerson的，但是也给他投了赞成票。<br><br>

<b>Border co-operation</b>
<p>On the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Mexico extradited Joaquín Guzmán, the boss of the Sinaloa drug gang, to America. Mr Guzmán, better known as El Chapo (Shorty), twice escaped from Mexican jails. He pleaded not guilty to 17 charges in a federal court in New York.</p>

　　在特朗普的就职演讲前夕，墨西哥引渡Sinaloa毒品团伙的老板Joaquín Guzmán到了美国。Guzmán的另外一个名字El Chapo（简称）更出名，他两次从墨西哥的监狱逃走。他在纽约的联邦法庭的对17项指控进行辩护。<br>

<p>Teori Zavascki, a justice on Brazil’s supreme court, died in the crash of a private aeroplane. Mr Zavascki oversaw investigations into allegations that politicians milked Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, for hundreds of millions of dollars. See <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21715693-tragedy-highlights-growing-political-influence-supreme-court-death-brazilian).">article</a> </p>

　　墨西哥的一个法官Teori Zavascki因为所乘私人飞机坠毁而死亡。Zavascki正着手调查一桩涉及Petrobras的多位政客的案件，涉嫌金额有数百万美元。参见 <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21715693-tragedy-highlights-growing-political-influence-supreme-court-death-brazilian).">文章</a> 。<br><br>

<b>Spoiling for a fight</b>
<p>A spokesman for Donald Trump reiterated that his administration would seek to block China from occupying islands that do not belong to it in the South China Sea. The statement prompted anger in China and consternation among America’s allies.</p>

　　特朗普的一个发言人重复他将会采取一定的措施来防止中国在男孩占领不属于中国的岛屿。此言论引起了中国的愤怒以及协约国的恐慌。<br><br>

<p>Authorities in Afghanistan issued arrest warrants for several bodyguards of Abdul Rashid Dostum, the vice-president. They are accused of beating and sexually assaulting a rival politician on their boss’s orders. The case is being seen as a test of the rule of law.</p>
　　阿富汗当局近日批准了几个副总统的保镖。他们被指控受命于其老板而性骚扰其政敌。这种情形被视为对法律的挑战。<br>

<p>Nursultan Nazarbayev, the long-serving president of Kazakhstan, promised to devolve more authority to the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, in a move seen as a preparation for an eventual transition of power.</p>

　　哈沙克斯坦长期服役的总统Nursultan Nazarbayev,承诺移交更多的权利到本国的橡皮章国会。此举被视为对最终移交权利的准备。<br><br>

<p>China announced a crackdown on unauthorised providers of services that allow internet users to circumvent the country’s web-censorship mechanisms. Government permission is now needed to sell access to virtual private networks (VPNs), as the services are known. The authorities also closed the website of Unirule, a prominent liberal think-tank in Beijing.</p>

　　中国声称要对非授权的提供允许互联网用户躲避互联网审查机制的服务的服务提供商进行惩罚。现在卖VPN权限也要得到政府的授权了。当局还关闭了一个著名的自由派智囊团(think-tank)Unirule(天则经济研究所)的网站。<br><br>

<p>The Chinese government said its decision in 2015 to allow all couples to have two children had paid off. Last year, according to the health authority, 18.5m babies were born in Chinese hospitals, up by 11.5% on 2015 and the most since 2000. Of the new babies, 45% were second children. But there is little evidence that the number of children a Chinese woman can expect to have during her lifetime has risen.</p>

　　中国政府2015年公布了开放二胎的决定。去年，根据卫生当局的数据，有185万婴儿在中国的医院出生，超过了2015年婴儿出生数量的11.5%，并达到了自2000年来的最大值。在新生儿中，有45%为二胎。但是少有证据表明中国妇女在一生中希望的孩子数量上升了。<br><br>

<p>In a January surprise, Germany’s Social Democrats picked Martin Schulz, the ex-president of the European Parliament, to lead their party in federal elections in September.

<p>Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that the government must obtain Parliament’s approval before triggering Article 50, the legal means of leaving the European Union. The court’s decision was expected, but, fortunately for the government, it also dismissed the need for devolved assemblies, such as in Scotland, to be consulted. Theresa May, the prime minister, promised to set out the details of the government’s Brexit plan in a “white paper”, a policy document. See article.</p>

　　英国的最高法庭宣布政府必须得到在启动第50号退欧的法案之前必须得到国会的同意。法院的决定在意料之中，但是，对政府来说幸运的是，它也解除了向地方议会的询问意见的需要，比如苏格兰的议会。英国首相Theresa May，承诺以政策文档“白皮书”的形式公布更多关于英国退欧的细节。参见<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21715674-supreme-courts-ruling-leaves-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland-without-say-brexit-will">文章</a><br><br>
