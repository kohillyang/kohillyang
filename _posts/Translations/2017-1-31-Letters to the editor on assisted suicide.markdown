<img src="{{ site.cdn_prefix }}/2017-1-31-img001.jpg" style="float:right;"><p>You say that the police in Britain are increasingly turning a blind eye to assisted suicide (“A matter of life and death”, January 14th). Declining to prosecute is not the same thing as turning a blind eye. Prosecutorial discretion exists for all criminal offences, not just for assisting suicide. A decision to prosecute has to take into account not only whether the law has been broken but whether there has been criminal behaviour involved.</p>

　　你们说警察在伦敦越来越对被协助的自杀睁一只眼闭一只眼了（“一种生存和死亡的方式”，一月14日刊）。减少指控与无视它们是两码事。起诉裁量权对所有的刑事犯罪都存在，而不仅仅是协助他人自杀。决定是否起诉不仅仅要考虑这个人是否违法，还要考虑这个人有没有犯罪行为。<br>

<p>The existing law holds penalties in reserve that are sufficient to make anyone who is minded to assist a suicide think carefully before doing so. As a result the numbers are very small. Cases where there has been serious soul-searching and genuinely compassionate intent are not generally considered to merit prosecution. This does not, however, provide a reliable indication of what would happen under a law licensing assistance with suicide. Look at Oregon, which went down this road in 1997. The number of legal assisted suicides there has been rising steadily, and steeply in recent years.</p>

当前法律保留惩罚的权利足够能让协助自杀的人在做之前能仔细思考。因此协助自杀的人在数量上是非常少的。考虑如果有深刻的自我反省，以及真诚的慈悲情怀，一般是选择不起诉的。但是，这并不能提供关于在法律授权的协助自杀下会发生什么的可靠说明。比如Oregon（美国的一个州），在1997年就在法律上允许自杀协助，并且自那以后，Oregon合法的协助自杀的数量一直在稳定地上升，并且近年来上升的斜率十分陡峭。<br>

<p>Evidence for your claim that hundreds of terminally are taking their own lives is also open to question. And it is not suicide that is unlawful but encouraging or assisting suicide. Or are you suggesting that if terminally ill people are taking their own lives the proper response should be to help them on their way?</p>

　　你们提到的数百个人病危患者正在结束自己的声明的证据也存疑。并不是自杀有罪，而是鼓励人自杀有罪。或者你们是不是想表达这样的观点："当病危病人在结束自己的生命的时候，我们应当给予适当的帮助来帮助他们结束自己的生命“？
<p>This is a complex and sensitive subject which needs to be considered objectively and with care. Your article read like a campaigning document.</p>

　　这是一个复杂的而且敏感的主题，需要十分仔细的客观的仔细的考虑。而你的文章我读起来似乎有些偏激。<br><br>
