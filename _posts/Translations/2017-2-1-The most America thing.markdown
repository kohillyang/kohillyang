<p> In terms of temperament, I have always been what I think of as American: adventurous, convinced of myself, contradictory. But I was born in Canada, to parents who were born in the Philippines, and, although I was in kindergarten when we moved to Texas, I didn’t become a U.S. citizen until eight years ago, in 2009. It was my last year of college, and I had applied to the Peace Corps, which requires volunteers to be citizens over the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>　　关于性格，我总是把我想象成一个美国人：喜欢冒险，自信，能言善辩。但是我出生在加拿大，我的父母出生在菲律宾，而且，尽管我是在我还在幼儿园的时候就搬到了德克萨斯州，我还是直到八年前，也就是2009年才成为美国公民。那是我大学生活的最后一年，那一年我向Peace Corps投递了申请书，因为那儿需要十八岁以上的志愿者。</p>
<p>Until that point, I had been a permanent resident, like my parents. My green-card photo showed me in three-quarter profile: tanned and smiling, black hair behind a headband, four years old. From that point on, I had an American upbringing so wholesome and institutional that it borders on archetype. I lived on the outskirts of Houston, riding tiny bicycles with a posse of small blond children across barely developed pasture studded with cheap model homes. I attended a private school, through a succession of scholarships, where the mascot was a bald eagle and we pledged allegiance three times every morning: to the American flag, the Texas flag, and the Christian flag, which is a real thing. I spent Friday nights in high school with bows in my hair and a megaphone beside me, cheering for our awful football team underneath the flushed Southern sky. I won another scholarship to the University of Virginia, where I joined a sorority and did keg stands in sundresses. I waited tables on weekends, I volunteered for the National Parks Service, I was brand-loyal to Budweiser. I was American through and through.</p>
<p>在那之前，我曾成为一个永久区民，就像我的父母一样。我的绿卡上的照片显示了我四年前的大部分外表特征：黑皮肤，爽朗的笑容，以及我的黑头发。从那之后，我享受着美国健全的公共福利制度。我生活在休斯顿的市郊，骑着我的小自行车，带着一群金黄色头发的孩子，穿过人烟稀少的牧场。凭借奖学金，我进入了一个私人学校，那个学校的吉祥物是一只秃鹰。我们每天要拜三次，一次是向美国国旗，一次是德克萨斯州州旗，还有一次是向基督教的标志，这是真的。我高中每周五晚上都会带上我的发卡（with bowls in my hair），还有我的扩音器，为我们的让人在令人激动的天空下的让人敬畏的足球队加油。我在周末就当服务员，我还是National Parks Service的志愿者，我是Budweiser的铁杆粉丝。我从头到脚都是一个美国人。</p>

<p>But I had never cared much about making it official. Like many children of Asian immigrants who grow up in conservative white communities, I was brutally aware of racial discrimination, as well as the fact that I was often given some sort of arbitrary personal pass. I was deeply disturbed by the prosperity-gospel patriotism that surrounded me in Texas, the exclusions it implied for all sorts of minorities, including the poor. And so I liked my in-between status. That I didn’t have to belong to this country to give to it and to take from it wholeheartedly seemed like the most American thing in the world.</p>
<p>
  但是我从未把它变得更为正式一点。像在白人社区长大的大多数亚洲移民一样，我非常害怕种族歧视，以及我经常被迫接受各式各样的个人通行证的事实（arbitrary presonal pass）。 在德克萨斯州，我非常受美国例外论（prosperity-gospel patriotism）， 以及对少数民族的包括贫穷在内各种偏见的困扰。所以我并不是必须要给这个国家或者从这个国家拿到所谓的最美国的事物。
</p>

<p>Then Barack Obama was elected President, and I felt like I’d come out from underwater—like all that lacquered rhetoric about the land of opportunity really meant something, like someone had unexpectedly reassured me that I belonged. I could feel America’s magic working on me—that sense of acceleration and unexpected possibility. I was twenty, and I suddenly wanted to be affiliated. I wanted to join the Peace Corps, with its hippie name and its old-fashioned logo, a flag that sloped and waved into an abstract peace sign, the stars on the blue turning into doves. I liked the idea of being an official representative of America: someone who immigrated, whose parents had immigrated, who had brown skin and no small amount of double consciousness, and was a part of this country as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>
后来奥巴马被选上了总统。并且我觉得我从水下出来了————就像一些花言巧语说的机会的大陆真的意味着什么，就像有人向我再三保证我是属于美国的一样。我能感觉到美国的魔法在我身上起作用了————那种血液沸腾的感觉，那种无所不能的感觉。我当时20岁，然后我就突然想加入了。我想加入Peace Corp，我想跟它的嬉皮名字(hippie name)和它的过时的旗帜一起，那是一面倾斜着，与蓝色背景下映衬着的变向和平鸽的星星的抽象的和平标志一起在空中摇曳的旗帜。我突然十分喜欢变成官方美国人的主意：本人是移民，爸妈也是移民，有着棕色的皮肤，并且没有双重意识，像所有其他美国人一样的美国人。
</p>

<p>So I applied for citizenship. It was an expensive, lengthy, and difficult process, and I can’t imagine that the process is ever much easier for anyone than it was for me, as a permanent resident who was employed and educated, had no children to look after, and was comfortable enough with paperwork that I could do my taxes without a hitch. I drove back and forth to D.C., getting fingerprinted, fixing clerical errors, taking the written citizenship test. By the time I sat down for my final oral interview, I had spent hours whiling away time in waiting rooms with families who had put so much more on the table. I had become a little obsessed with the immigrant’s relationship to America—how you generally love something more when you’ve had to work for it, how seeing the holes in a country’s grand narrative of inclusion can make a person want to stitch that narrative up.</p>

因此我开始申请公民身份。这是一个非常费钱，费时间，还很艰难的过程。并且我无法想象我比其他任何人有多么的更不容易，作为一个被雇佣的，受教育的永久居民，我没有孩子需要照顾。并且文书工作对我来说也足够舒适，我能很轻松的交我应交的税。我一次又一次地开车到华盛顿，采指纹，更正笔误，参加公民笔试。直到我参加最后的口试之前，我已经在与同样在上面付出很多努力的家人一起在等待室里等待了数个小时。我对美国的移民关系甚至是有一些痴迷————怎眼才能更爱一件你还不得不为它工作的事。~~怎样看一个国家的叙事漏洞才能让一个人想把这个洞给填上~~ 。<br>

<p>I was sworn in on March 20, 2009, in a courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. I had a terrible hangover and got very emotional. It’s at a citizenship ceremony where you see what America really means, more so than at any football game or church or National Park, any crowded city or suburban lawn. In a citizenship ceremony, you see this country’s first and only center, its promise of freedom and opportunity, which it has often issued with extreme dishonesty—and a group of people who want to accept that promise anyway. A woman named Natalya with a Russian accent stood up at the end of the ceremony and gave an ad-hoc speech about feeling American, how she felt that she had something powerful in common with everyone in the room. I don’t often feel unabashedly patriotic, but in front of Natalya? I jumped to my feet, with everyone else, and applauded.</p>
<p>我于2009年的三月20日在在弗吉尼亚州的Charlottesville的一个小法院宣誓(成为美国公民)。我那天喝醉了，并且变得非常情绪化。那是一个你可以看到成为一个美国人意味着什么的的公民仪式，这比你在足球比赛，在教堂，在国家公园，任何城市之中喧闹之地或者郊区草原看到的都要多。在这个公民仪式上，你看到了这个国家的首要的，最中心的部分，即它的虽被人指出是不诚实的，对自由与机会做出的，但是依旧有一部分人愿意去接受它的承诺。一个名叫Natalya的拥有俄国口音的人在仪式即将结束的时候站起来发表了一个专门关于成为美国人的感受的演讲。她与房间里的每个人有着强烈的共鸣。我并不是经常感觉到不害臊的爱国主义，但是面对Natalya， 我与房间里的每一个人欢呼喝彩鼓掌。 </p>
<p>I have felt patriotic again in the days since Donald Trump’s Inauguration, in those moments when millions of Americans have exposed their civic conscience and gone to protest in the streets. The overwhelming aura in these demonstrations is one of love, the kind that really matters—the kind that can see something appalling and refuse to turn away. Since Trump issued his shockingly cruel executive order on Friday, forbidding entry into the United States to refugees from anywhere in the world and immigrants from a set of majority Muslim countries, the rhetoric that has abounded in clogged airports and public spaces all over the country has been the rhetoric of solidarity and inclusion, of not wanting to repeat history’s mistakes.</p>
<p>
从特朗普的就职演讲之后我又感觉到了爱国主义了，在那些时候，数百万的美国人展现了自己的公民意识，并且上街去保护它们。这种在游行中的压倒性的氛围是一种爱，这种看到事物可怕的一面并且拒绝回去的爱是非常重要的。从特朗普在周五签署了他的令人震惊的残忍的命令，禁止了世界各地的难民以及穆斯林国家的移民到美国之后，在拥挤的机场以及公共场所充满了对团结和包容的标语（rhrtoric），这是对不想重复历史错误的表达。
</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order has been challenged by lawyers, stayed by judges, disowned by State Department employees, and protested by a coalition whose anger and energy lawmakers would be wise not to ignore. Nonetheless, its toll has been immediate and grievous. Families have been broken up indefinitely, caregivers kept from their sick parents and children. People who endangered themselves to work for our military have been denied our protection. Refugees have been returned to what you might fairly call a death sentence. Foreign-born students have been advised that reëntry might not be possible if they leave the country. Plans that have taken decades of sacrifice have been derailed in an instant.</p>
<p>特朗普的行政命令已经收到了来自律师的威胁，受到了法官的阻止，国务院雇员的否认，以及受到了群众的联合抗议。法律制定者们如果足够明智的话，就不会忽略掉这些抗议者们的愤怒以及他们的力量。尽管如此，（特朗普依旧独断专行），造成了突如其来的痛苦的代价。家庭破裂，护理人员不得不从他们看护的病人身边离开，难民被遣返到对他们来说就是死刑之地的地方，外国学生被建议如果出了美国就再无回到美国的可能。本来希望得到广泛认可的计划如今早已偏离了它的轨道。
</p>

<p>One of the things I have found so moving about the intense public pushback to these tragedies is the readiness with which America’s central mythology has come back into hand. At the Battery Park protest this past weekend, the signs expressed identification with the people detained and turned away. Immigrants make America great, the posters said. We are all immigrants. Jesus was a refugee; the pilgrims were refugees. There was a sense in the air not just that we were all equals but that our origin stories were in some way arbitrary, even interchangeable. They aren’t, of course—not everyone came to this country voluntarily—but this stance is useful. We would do well to remember that we did nothing to determine the circumstances of our birth. Even within the small story of my family it feels like chance that I wasn’t born in Texas, like my little brother, or in the Philippines, like my parents. It’s only luck that the longstanding quotas on Asian immigration were lifted in 1965, two decades before my parents decided to move.</p>
<p>关于公众强烈阻止灾难的事实中一件让我感动的事情是美国的中心信念（central mythology）又欣然回到手中。在上周的周末的公园保卫战中，这种信号表示了人们与被捕人员的认同。海报上大大写着：移民让美国人变得强大。我们所有的人都是移民。耶稣是移民。朝圣者是移民。天空之中弥漫着我们不仅是等同的，甚至我们的起源(orgin stories)在某些方面是任意的(arbitrary)，乃至是可交换的的情绪。他们当然不是每个人都是志愿到这个国家的，但是这个立场(stance)是有用的。我们最好记得我们并不能为决定我们的出生。就像我一样，我没有机会像我的小弟弟一样在德克萨斯州出生，或者像我的父母一样在菲律宾出生。唯一值得幸运的是关于亚洲移民的长期配额的政策在1965年提出，那是我父母搬到美国的24年前。</p>

<p>For the most part, I have experienced America as the place it believes itself to be. I wasn’t born here. But while I have lived here people have been good to me, institutions have trusted that I would make something of their resources, and, above all, public policy has been generous at precisely the moments it determined my path. This remains a narrow, remarkable experience. It’s only chance that any of us—walking down a street, or through airport security—are ever spared the arbitrary, corrosive spotlight that comes from being born into whichever population the white American power structure has lately decided that it should fear.</p>

<p>大多数方面，我经历了一个真实的美国。 我不是在美国出生，但是我居住的地方人们对我很好,组织也认为我会有所作为，另外总之，公共政策在精确地决定我的人生轨迹的时候十分慷慨。这成为了一种非凡的体验。它是幸免于来自白人权利机构决定的出生自的家庭所应该面临的武断的，有腐蚀性的聚光灯的唯一机会。</p>
