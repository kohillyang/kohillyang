<p>China said it would suspend imports of coal from North Korea, all but eliminating one of the isolated communist state’s main sources of revenue. Malaysia, meanwhile, said it was looking for several North Korean officials in connection with the murder of the half-brother of Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator. See article.</p>

<p>中国声称它将会暂停从南韩进口煤。这无疑使本就被孤立的社会主义国家南韩（朝鲜）失去了主要的税收来源。马来西亚同时对外宣称他们正在与南韩关于南韩领导人金正恩的同父异母的兄弟一事进行一些官方的交流。</p>

### Tightening the border

<p>Mr Trump selected a new national security adviser following the defenestration of Mike Flynn. Lieutenant-General H.R. McMaster is an army officer who was widely praised for his command during the Iraq war, where he pursued a successful counter-insurgency strategy in the city of Tal Afar. See article.</p>

### Too close to call

<p>Ecuador’s presidential election looked likely to go to a second round in April, according to the electoral commission. With nearly all the votes counted, Lenín Moreno, the candidate backed by the president, Rafael Correa, is well ahead but appears to have fallen short of the 40% required to avoid a run-off. He will probably face Guillermo Lassom a conservative banker.</p>
<p>José Serra resigned as Brazil’s foreign minister, because of health problems. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency.</p>

### The last redoubt

<p>Iraq’s army launched its main assault on western Mosul, having captured the eastern half of the city from Islamic State last month. The fighting in the western half is expected to be harder. In Syria, Kurdish groups advanced against IS positions in the country. See article.</p>
An Israeli soldier who killed a wounded Palestinian attacker in Hebron a year ago was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Many were outraged, either because they thought the sentence too light; or because they thought he should not have been charged at all.</p>
<p>South Africa’s High Court blocked a move by the country’s president, Jacob Zuma, to withdraw from membership of the International Criminal Court, saying that he may not do so without consulting parliament. Some Africans see the court as targeting Africa disproportionately.</p>
<p>A famine was declared in parts of South Sudan, caused by a civil war and economic collapse. It is the first famine to be declared anywhere in the world in six years.</p>

### The centre ground

<p>In another twist to the French presidential race, François Bayrou, a centrist politician, announced that he would not run but would instead back Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister who is running as an independent. Although Mr Macron’s campaign has gathered momentum, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing National Front, still leads polls for the first round.</p>
<p>Selahattin Demirtas, the leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party in Turkey, was convicted of insulting the Turkish state (ie, criticising the president). The same day, a court upheld a conviction for terrorism of the other leader of the party. The trial also began of 47 former soldiers for alleged involvement in last years’ coup attempt.</p>

<p>Britain’s Brexit bill, which will permit the government to negotiate the country’s departure from the EU, was debated by the House of Lords, Parliament’s unelected upper house. Theresa May raised eyebrows by perching herself on the steps of the royal throne; it is three decades since a prime minister last attended a debate in the Lords. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned Britain that it should expect a hefty bill and would not leave the EU “at a discount or at zero cost”. See article.</p>
<p>Cressida Dick was appointed as the new commissioner of London’s Metropolitan Police, the first woman to head Britain’s biggest force. Ms Dick was in command of a botched operation that led to the killing of an innocent man after the terrorist attacks on London’s transport network in 2005. A subsequent inquiry exonerated her of any blame. See article.</p>
Matteo Renzi stepped down as the leader of Italy’s ruling Democratic Party amid criticism that he has failed to meet the challenge of the Five Star Movement, a rising populist party. Mr Renzi resigned as prime minister in December.
Keeping it in the family</p>

<p>The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, appointed his wife as vice-president. Mehriban Aliyeva is a member of parliament who runs a foundation named after the previous president, who was Mr Aliyev’s father.</p>
