　Good Morning, honored teachers, I'm Yangkeshan and I'm a student studying control theories in Class Automation 32 in Xi'an JiaoTong University. Last year, I took part in the postgraduate interview and got an pre-admission chance. And after the graduate entrance examination, I'm very proud to have this opportunity to introduce myself. In this introduction I'll cover several key areas, which I do think, are very important in paving the way for researching in the following three years as an graduate student. Theses areas are theories, practice, and communication.

　The first area, theory, which I do think, is the base of researching. In my four years studying life, I have learnt losts of lessons, and I can also take them into paractice, for example, after lesson Analog Electronics, I can make a boost or bulk circuit controled by microprocessor unit with some closed loop algorithms by myself; After lesson Classics control theory, I can write a porgram to control a smart car using PID algorithm, and, in fact, it works well. After self-learning of inertial Navigation System, I can control a quadrotor using some modern algorithms like Kalman fiter. and after Digital signal process, I can write a simple multi-layer perceptron network to recognise a number, and so on.

　The sencond area, practice ability, which I think, is a tool which can help you speed your research up. And in this area, I can write programs with many language, like verilog, C plus plus, Qt, C#, C51, and python. I can write programs for lots of chips, like Freescale K60 series, Atmel avr series, C51 series, and FPGA like xilink x70a series or Altera EP series. In the Item design, I written a program to make the camera picture can be seen in a more easy way, I was very glad to see the result that it save many students' debuging time.

　And In the last area, named communication, which also plays a necessary role in researching, I'm the chair of IBM student technology club, and when I have also ever lead my team to gain the secong-prize in the national undergrated  elctronic design design. I'm comfortable to say that there is no problem in this aspect.
  That's my self-introduction, thank you for your listenning.
