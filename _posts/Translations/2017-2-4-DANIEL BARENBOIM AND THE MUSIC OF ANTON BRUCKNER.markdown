<p>while I didn’t have the privilege of lounging in a cigar bar with the celebrated conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, I did have the pleasure of attending three concerts of his cycle of Bruckner Symphonies at Carnegie Hall with the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra, which closed on Sunday afternoon—the first complete cycle ever presented there. For an accurate overview, I decided to take in three of the nine symphonies, each of a different type: a sleeper (the Third), a problem child (the Fifth), and a universal favorite (the Seventh).</p>
<p>尽管我没有与著名管弦乐指挥家兼钢琴家Daniel Barenboim 一起在吸烟室了休息的特权，但是我依旧十分享受参加他的三场在Carnegie大礼堂举办的与管弦乐队 Staatskapelle Berlin一起对Bruckner交响曲进行单曲循环的音乐会。Carnegie大礼堂在星期天的下午关门——第一场表演在那儿展开。准确来说：我决定参加他的九场交响曲中的三场，每一场的~~类型~~叙事角度都不同：第三场一个在睡梦中的人(a sleeper)，第五场是一个问题儿童(problem child)，以及第七场的幸运儿(universal favorite)。 </p>

<p>Attentive listeners like to dialogue about Bruckner these days, chewing on either the problematic aspects of the music itself or on the unpleasant associations with German nationalism that accrued to the music, even during the composer’s own lifetime. But not Daniel Barenboim. This is because Barenboim is a Bruckner Guy, and his devotion has been lifelong. Most of the great conductors have had a preference for either Bruckner or Mahler, Bruckner’s successor as a creator of giant late-Romantic Viennese symphonies: it’s a matter of taste. (Leonard Bernstein was the world’s most devoted Mahler Guy, whereas Eugen Jochum is remembered today as a great Brucknerite and little else. Herbert von Karajan recorded a complete cycle of Bruckner symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic, but not a Mahler set; the orchestra’s current principal conductor, Simon Rattle, has taken the opposite approach, covering all the Mahler symphonies with the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra but recording only a handful of Bruckner’s.) Barenboim came to Mahler eventually, but his feelings are complicated, and he has never recorded a complete Mahler set; in contrast, he has recorded the complete Bruckner symphonies three times, most recently with the Staatskapelle. His first set, with the Chicago Symphony, even included the early “Symphony No. 0,” which only the most ardent Brucknerites will tolerate and which was wisely left out of the Carnegie cycle.</p>
专注的听众这些日子谈论Bruckner的问题要么是关于这个音乐本身的问题，要么是关于与积聚在该音乐上的德国种族主义的不愉快关联，纵使这种创作者生前的关联与Daniel Barenboim并无关系。这是因为Barenboim是一个布鲁克纳粉丝（ Bruckner Guy）,他对Bruckner的爱慕是一生的。<b>大部分音乐指挥家都曾喜爱过Bruckner, Mahler，或者是Bruckner的大型晚期浪漫主义的继承者：总之这是个人口味问题。</b>（比如Leonard Bernstein 就是这个世界上最忠诚的Mahler粉丝，反之Eugen Jochum就虽然也很爱慕大部分音乐指挥家都曾喜爱过Bruckner，但是他也喜欢别人.Herbert von Karajan与Berlin Philharmonic一起录制过Bruckner的交响曲，但是并没有Mahler的份。管弦乐队目前的首席指挥家Simon Rattle则相反，他与柏林爱乐乐团（Berlin Philharmonics），维也纳爱乐乐团（Vienna Philharmonics），以及伯明翰市立交响乐团（City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra）演奏的音乐覆盖了所有的Mahler的交响乐，但是他指挥Bruckner创作的交响乐屈指可数。Barenboim最后投入到了Mahler的怀抱，但是他的感情是复杂的，他从没有录制一首完整的Mahler创作的曲子。相反，他先后三次完整地录制过Bruckner的交响乐，最近的一次是和Staatskapelle一起录制的。他的第一部作品，（当时是）与芝加哥交响乐（Chicago Symphony）（一起演出的），甚至包含了第0交响乐中的早些内容，而这些内容只有最狂热的Bruckner粉丝能够容忍。在Carnegie的演出中，他很明智地把这些内容去掉了。

<p>Most conductors today are primarily Mahler people, since Mahler’s febrile sensibility and eclectic musical language have long proved more appealing to modern audiences—the kind of listeners whom Bernstein, in his recordings and innumerable television appearances, first roused in the United States in the nineteen-fifties. You can hear great Bruckner with the Cleveland Orchestra and its Austrian conductor, Franz Welser-Möst, but the only North American conductor today with a distinctive Bruckner approach may be the Canadian maestro Yannick Nézet-Séguin, whose light, almost chamber-style interpretation with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal, on record, comes close to making the Second Symphony actually sound convincing. The Second has a sublime slow movement, but the rest is training-wheels stuff. That’s why I began my Bruckner experience with the Symphony No. 3 in D Minor, which Barenboim led on January 21st.</p>
<p>
大部分交响乐指挥家如今都主要指挥马勒（Mahler）的交响曲，因为马勒的充沛的情感与放荡不羁的音乐语言如今都已被证明更吸引现代观众——伯恩斯坦（Bernstein）在二十世纪50年代以他的唱片，数不清的电视节目唤醒的第一批观众。你可以听到伟大的布鲁克纳（Bruckner）与克利夫兰管弦乐团（Cleveland Orchestra）以及他的美洲指挥家Franz Welser-Möst一起演奏的音乐，但是还留存着布鲁克纳风格的北美指挥家恐怕只有加拿大的大师Nézet-Séguin了，他的轻柔的，近乎室内风格与管弦乐队Métropolitain de Montréal一起的演出几乎让第二交响曲听起来如此地让人震撼。第二交响曲有着庄严的且舒缓的乐章，但是其他的部分却是车轮式的填塞（training-wheels stuff）。这是为什么我转而去听巴伦布瓦姆1月21号在以d小调指挥的布鲁克纳的第三交响曲的原因。
</p>
<p>The Third Symphony has never been among the most popular of the set, but connoisseurs have always treasured it. (Nikolaus Harnoncourt, in particular, made a jubilant recording of it.) Like Haydn’s Forty-Second Symphony or Elliott Carter’s First String Quartet, it is a kind of attenuated graduation piece, a work in which a composer of high promise already in middle age finally gets his stuff together and writes an unquestioned masterpiece, a citadel that no critic can pull down. Bruckner’s invention is exuberant throughout: the finale confidently transforms the tragic mood of the first movement into triumph, and the scherzo is a more optimistic forerunner of the Ninth Symphony’s, by which time the aged composer’s mood had turned to proto-Expressionist darkness. A trace of nervously fresh mastery, however, occurs at the beginning of the slow movement. Although the work earned the nickname “Wagner Symphony” for its brief allusions to themes from Wagner’s operas, the stately Adagio’s first twenty seconds could easily have been by Handel—until a quiet stab of harmonic pain trips off a chain of sequences, dipping downward into the murk of painful memory.</p>
<p>笫三交响曲从未成为最流行的那一部分,但是它仍被许多鉴赏家像珍宝一样捧在怀中,(尼古劳斯·哈农库特(Nikolaus Harnoncourt)甚至在录完这首曲子之后欣喜若狂），就像的海顿(Haydn)的第四十二交响曲或者埃略特·卡特(Elliott Carter)的一弦四重奏一样，它是一项毕业作品，是创作者在中年汇聚人生积聚的所有力量的杰作，是无法被批评家摧毁的城堡。
布鲁克纳的发明贯穿始终：结局自然地将第一场乐章的悲伤转为欢喜，诙谐曲部分是第九交响曲的更乐观的先驱，这时年老的创作者的情绪已经变为无尽的黑暗，然而，在缓慢的时间的流逝的初始，又出现了一丝紧张的新鲜的掌控。尽管对瓦格纳的歌剧主题的简明诠释使它赢得了瓦格纳交响曲的昵称，但这个庄严的阿达焦的前二十二秒仍然很容易在汉德尔的控制下将人们拉入到黑暗的痛苦记忆之中。
</p>
<p>Barenboim ’s Berliners responded well to the challenge: thrilling, heart-in-the-throat moments abounded. The Staatskapelle orchestra, which during the Cold War had been the ensemble of East Berlin’s leading opera house, no longer has quite the antique sheen that it did when Barenboim brought it to Carnegie for an electrifying Schumann series, in 2004. The orchestra is now a younger one, though the basic sound, more transparent than that of the Berlin Philharmonic, is still burnished and attractive. (It must also be said, however, that the player-for-player virtuosity of the Philharmonic is still superior.)</p>

<p>柏林人对巴伦布瓦姆的反应十分良好：兴奋而又充满着无尽的悲伤。在冷战时期，这个管弦乐队曾是西柏林的著名歌剧院的合奏团，如今早已没有当巴伦布瓦姆为一种令人振奋的舒曼风格而将它给卡内基的时期的光辉。现在的乐队更为年轻，尽管现在的基础声音（basic sound）更为通俗，但是它仍然十分清澈而令人神往 。</p>

<p>With the exception of the mammoth Eighth Symphony, none of the symphonies fills an entire evening, so Barenboim preluded each of the others with a concerto by Mozart; and it was this choice that revealed something essential about Barenboim’s nature, in which emotional intensity seeks intellectual counterpoise. The most important thing to know about a successful Barenboim concert is that, like Rilke’s Swan—the French one, not the German one—it is “a whole moving space.” The ligatures between one work and another are invisible but of tensile strength; Bruckner followed Mozart as in a further chapter of a novel, or as, in a life, a turbulent adulthood presses on after a more innocent youth. Barenboim conducted the Piano Concerto No. 24 in C Minor from the keyboard, and it was magnificent. (In the concerts I attended, he never used a score in Mozart or in Bruckner.) He has little interest in the period-performance movement, which most leading musicians have at least acknowledged in their practice. But for him it hardly hurts. This is proudly post-Wagnerian Mozart, performed by an opera-house ensemble that knows each composer’s music intimately. Not that there was anything heavy or pompous about it: sitting with his back to the audience, Barenboim faced the woodwind section like friends at a formal but friendly dinner party. (Barenboim is both a serious man and a committed bon vivant.) Tempos were moderate, the fasts never too fast, the slows never dragging weight. The blushing beauty of the Larghetto was haunted by Barenboim’s light keyboard touch and empyrean mood: he could have been summoning ghosts. At the doleful close of the first movement, the double basses reached down to their sepulchral low-C extensions, a sound that didn’t exist during Mozart’s lifetime.</p>

<p>庞大的第八交响曲是个例外，没有交响曲能坚持一个晚上，所以巴伦布瓦姆为每一首交响曲加了一首莫扎特的前奏。这是表现巴伦布瓦姆的准则的一种方式——在理性与感性之中达到平衡。了解巴伦布瓦姆成功的音乐会的最重要的方面是——它的每个角落都扣人心弦，就像法国而不是德国的克尔天鹅。作品之间的联系虽然不可见但是却充满着巨大的能量。就像是在小说，乃至人生之中的天真烂漫的童年之后的成年，莫扎特成就了布鲁克纳。巴伦布瓦姆以C小调指挥了第24号钢琴演奏曲十分宏大。（在我参加的音乐会中，他从不在莫扎特或者布鲁克纳的曲子中使用配乐）。他对大多数一流音乐家至少在他们的实践中都承认的循环表演（period-performance movement）少有兴趣。但是这对他并无影响。这是由每个人都对每个创作者的音乐都十分亲切的合奏团演奏的华格纳作风的莫扎特。
</p>
<p>It should be said, though, that to follow Mozart with Bruckner does reveal some of the latter man’s weaknesses. Mozart, like Mahler, was simply a better composer. His melodic material is more varied, his expressive range infinitely broader, his orchestration far more piquant and inventive. When Mozart—or Mahler—writes a woodwind melody, its timbral coloring and registral placement are so flawless that it would seem to have been born inside the instrument itself. While Bruckner did have a certain affection for the flute (its shivering excitement in the trio section of the Ninth’s scherzo is one example), most of his wind melodies are generically windy. Oboes pine. Clarinets gurgle in arpeggios, because that’s what clarinets do. The poor bassoons hardly do more than double the cello section.</p>

<p>Sure, Bruckner was trying to imitate the euphonious blend of the pipe organ, of which he was an unchallenged virtuoso. But, in fact, a Bruckner symphony is basically a symphony for strings and brass, the limits of which were laid out in Barenboim’s traversal of the Fifth Symphony, on January 24th. (That performance was preceded by Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante, K. 297b, for winds and orchestra; the standout soloist was a distinguished guest, the hornist Radovan Vlatković.) The Fifth is difficult to bring off. Its themes are overlong and, for Bruckner, uninspired. The orchestration is plain and dun-colored, without the Third’s excited gleam. Its obsession with contrapuntal display makes the middle registers (the octaves around middle C on the piano) sound clogged and overcrowded. And the finale, with its endless thematic sequences, its crushing shafts of sound, its formal segments following each other like so many railway cars, is just too damn long. In the end, the Fifth is more notable for showing us what Bruckner could do, rather than what he did do. The symphony was useful: Bruckner opened up temporal space and proved his contrapuntal craft, but that musical muscle stretching would serve him better in the glorious Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Symphonies. Perhaps it takes an Austrian genius like Harnoncourt to understand the Fifth: his recording takes on a mystical air, with the first-movement Adagio-Allegro transformed into a dream sequence of marches and chorales. Kind of like, you know, Mahler.</p>

<p>Barenboim’s lack of interest in the ur-Austria of lakes, meadows, and mountain peaks didn’t hurt his interpretation of the Seventh Symphony, one of the composer’s supreme masterpieces, which he led on January 27th. (Its prelude was Mozart’s beloved Sinfonia Concertante in E-Flat Major for Violin and Viola, with two of the Staatskapelle’s principal strings as soloists.) From the muscular serenity of its opening bars, the Seventh is a triumph: its proportions are shapely, its themes striving and memorable, its moods convincingly trenchant or painfully vulnerable. As with the Mozart piano concerto, Barenboim’s tempos were moderately paced; with the first and fourth “fast” movements containing so much slow music, the only time Bruckner allows the orchestra to rip is in the “Sehr schnell” (very fast) third-movement Scherzo, and Barenboim didn’t quite take the bait. For the record, he employed the optional cymbal crash at the climax of the slow movement, but not the optional triangle; those yearning for the full Wagnerian effect might have gone home disappointed. But the Seventh brought Barenboim’s great talent as a conductor of Wagner’s operas to the fore. Within those tempos, all was transition, the passing measures continually inflected with subtle and sensual shifts of pacing that went far beyond the composer’s stated instructions—something which Bruckner, the perfect Wagnerite, might well have loved.</p>

<p>Besides their continuum of musical content, the three concerts I witnessed had similarly ample audiences. Bruckner fans showed up in droves, and I’d guess that the composer found many new friends as well. Much of this is due to Barenboim, and to the unapologetic seriousness he brings to these performances, and to his entire musical life. Asked, in an interview, about the composer’s current relevance, he stated, “If music is only a question of entertainment and the pleasure of a pastime, then obviously Bruckner is not the composer for you. If music is an expression of what can be expressed that cannot be expressed in any other way—namely with words—then Bruckner is of extreme importance.” Lenny Bernstein revealed Mahler, in all his neurotic and melodramatic variety, to be the ultimate composer of the Cold War, the roiling emotional volcano underneath the era’s crushing certainties. But in an age in which previously cherished institutions and unquestioned political “norms” are newly in doubt, what Barenboim calls the “ferocious” character of Bruckner’s music, which combines formidable complexity with utter simplicity, may be a compensatory tonic. Perhaps, in America, Bruckner’s time has finally come.</p>
