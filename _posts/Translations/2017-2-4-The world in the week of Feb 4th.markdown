<p>America’s refugee policy was thrown into turmoil by Donald Trump’s executive order to halt all refugee admissions for four months and ban Syrian refugees indefinitely. In addition, all citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen were stopped from entering the United States for three months. The directive, issued without any input from the federal agencies that have to implement it, caused confusion in America and abroad, trapping people at airports. An almighty constitutional battle looms.</p><img src="{{ site.cdn_prefix }}/2017-2-4-img003.jpg" style="float: right">
<p>美国的由特朗普的行政命令所发布的难民政策如今已造成混乱，该难民政策暂停批准所有的难民请求长达120天，并禁止三个月内所有的来自伊朗，伊拉克，利比亚，索马里，苏丹，也门等六个国家的难民进入美国。特朗普发布的这条命令，并没有联邦机构的参与，让美国自己以及其他国家十分困惑——很多人滞留在机场。一场严肃的宪法战争迫在眉睫。</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions was approved as attorney-general by the relevant committee in the Senate. Mr Trump had earlier sacked the interim attorney-general, who was appointed as a stopgap until Mr Sessions could take office, after she told lawyers at the Justice Department not to defend the refugee ban.</p>
<p>相关委员会在参议院批准杰夫·赛辛斯成为司法部部长。特朗普早些时候解雇了临时司法部部长（萨利·耶茨（Sally Yates）），因为她曾让律师在法庭不要为难民禁令辩护。
</p>
In another controversial move Mr Trump gave Stephen Bannon, his senior political strategist, a seat on the National Security Council. The director of the CIA is also to join, but the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence were demoted on the NSC. They will now attend only when “issues pertaining to their responsibilities” are discussed.
<p>特朗普给他的高级政治战略家斯蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）在国家安全委员会（NSC）的职位也饱受争议。CIA的首脑也要进入NSC，但是首长联席会议（JCS）的主席以及国家情报局的局长却在NSC被降职。他们现在只在问题有他们的责任的时候才会参与讨论。</p>
Neil Gorsuch was nominated by Mr Trump to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Antonin Scalia a year ago. Mr Gorsuch is a federal appeals court judge from Colorado with a solid conservative record. Democrats in the Senate are in no mood to smooth the path of his confirmation.
尼尔·戈萨奇（Neil Gorsuch）被特朗普提名填补最高法庭由于 安东宁·斯卡利亚（Antonin Scalia）一年前死亡造成的职位空缺。戈萨奇是来自科罗拉多的联邦上诉法院的法官，他之前的保守立场十分坚定。参议院的民主党他的就职表示反对。<br>
