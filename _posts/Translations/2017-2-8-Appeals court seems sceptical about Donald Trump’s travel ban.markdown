<p>AT an extraordinary, phoned-in hearing on February 7th, three federal judges heard arguments in Washington v Trump, a fight over the legality and constitutionality of the 45th president’s order suspending America’s refugee programme and banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. The executive order, announced on January 27th, was halted on February 3rd when a federal district judge in Seattle, James Robart, issued a temporary restraining order against it in response to a complaint by the state of Washington (later joined by Minnesota) that the ban was causing irreparable harm to “employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel”. The Trump administration reacted with a series of angry tweets (including a dismissal of Mr Robart as a “so-called judge”) and asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to reverse the judge’s decision and reinstate the travel restrictions.</p>

<p>2月7日在美国西雅图法庭举办的听证会上，三位联邦法官听取了针对特朗普的激烈的争论。这场争论焦点集中在美国第45任总统的暂停接受难民入境以及永久停止来自七个穆斯林国家的签证签发的行政命令是否合法。由于联邦行政法官詹姆斯·罗巴特在西雅图宣布的临时限制令，这个于1月27日发布的行政命令在2月3号被暂停，因为美国华盛顿州以及随后加入的明尼苏达州抱怨这个禁令可能会对就业，教育，商业，家庭等方面造成不可挽回的伤害。特朗普在推特上发表了一系列的文章来表达他的愤怒，包括对罗伯特先生的解雇，理由是"他居然是这样的法官"，他还让在旧金山的第九巡回上诉法庭驳回法官的决定以恢复禁令。</p>

Only 96 hours elapsed between the order lifting the ban and the appeals court’s hearing to reconsider it, leading lawyers for Washington state and the Justice department to lament during the argument, which lasted more than an hour, that the proceedings were moving awfully fast. 
August Flentje, the attorney defending Mr Trump’s plans, had the rougher stint before the judges, William Canby, Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland. 
Mr Flentje began by arguing that Mr Robart’s ruling had “upset” the “balance” the Trump administration had struck between “welcoming people into our country” and “making sure our country is secure”. That balancing is the task of the “political branches”, he said, not the courts. But when pressed repeatedly to cite evidence showing that the seven countries covered by the ban—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—posed an actual risk of terrorism to America, Mr Flentje had little to offer. Merely mentioning Obama administration judgments about the countries in 2015, one judge complained, is “pretty abstract”.
<p>从罗伯特先生发布禁令到上述法院举行听证会仅仅96个小时，这让华盛顿州的法官在这场持续了超过了一个小时的争论中十分不好过。然而议程在极其迅速地推进。特朗普的辩护律师August Flentje在法官威廉·坎比，理查德·克利夫顿，理查德·克利夫顿判决之前，做了一些粗糙的工作。首先Flentje先生声称罗伯特先生所发布的限制令破坏了特朗普所致力于达到的欢迎别国到本国来与维护本国的安全之间的平衡。这种平衡应该属于“政治的分支”的任务，而不是法庭的任务。但是当媒体一再重复让他摆出禁令所覆盖的七个国家——伊朗，伊拉克，利比亚，索马里，苏丹，叙利亚，也门对美国存在实在的恐怖主义威胁的证据的时候，Flentje却一再推脱，他仅仅提到了2015年奥巴马执政时期法庭关于这七个国家的判决，对此证据，一位法官抱怨称：“这实在太抽象了”。</p>

<p>Facing steady resistance from the panel, Mr Flentje said, late in his presentation, “I’m not sure I’m convincing the court”. He then switched to an apparent plan B, pleading with the judges to at least consider lifting Mr Robart’s restraining order with regard to “people who have never been to the US”. Washington state’s arguments, Mr Flentje said, were premised on harms imposed on lawful permanent residents of the United States. But their case, Mr Trump’s lawyer insisted, provides no good reason to give every foreign national from those seven countries free rein to fly to America.</p>

<p>遭到全体陪审团的一致抵触之后，Flentje在随后的陈述说，我不太确定我是否信服于法庭了。随后他切换到了B计划——请求法官至少把限制令放宽至从来没有到美国的人。华盛顿州的辩论的焦点在于禁令也伤害到了美国的合法永久居民的权利。但是对此，特朗普的律师坚持认为没有任何合适的理由来允许来自这七个国家的居民自由出入美国。
</p>

<p>This last-ditch argument—that Mr Robart’s move went too far, covered too much—was Mr Flentje’s best, though he spent only a few minutes developing it. It was resurrected in the second half of the hearing when Mr Clifton put it to Noah Purcell, the lawyer from Washington state. In response, Mr Purcell noted a couple of reasons why the travel ban should be halted in its entirety: in targeting Muslims, he said, it violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause; and the interests of long-time residents of America are harmed when their relatives in the Middle East and North Africa are banned from visiting them.</p>
<p>最后关于罗伯特的行为是否越权的辩论是Flentje发挥最好的时候，然而这仅仅花了他几分钟。在听证会的第二个半场克利夫顿让来自华盛顿州的律师诺亚珀塞尔陈述的时候，剧情又得到了反转。在对Flentje的回应中，珀塞尔列举了为什么这个禁令需要被完全暂停的两条原因：它目标直指穆斯林，这条违反了第一修正案。并且如果美国永久居民有在亲戚在中东或者北非的时候，他们的的利益会受到损害，</p>
<p>The toughest exchange for Mr Purcell came when Mr Clifton questioned the claim that Mr Trump’s travel ban discriminated against Muslims. The seven countries named in the ban, he noted, “encompass a small percentage” of the world’s Muslims—perhaps only about 15%. How can the ban be said to target Muslims if so many are left unaffected? Here Mr Purcell cited Mr Trump’s promise during the 2016 election that his intention was to ban Muslims and cited other recent public statements by Mr Trump and his allies demonstrating discriminatory motivation. Later, in a short rebuttal, Mr Flentje said that thwarting a president’s national security plans “based on some newspaper articles” was “extraordinary”.
</p>
<p>对于珀塞尔来说最艰难的时刻在当克利夫顿质疑特朗普的旅行禁令是否真的是对穆斯林国家的一种歧视的时候，克利夫顿提到，这条禁令只针对全球穆斯林国家的一小部分——大概只占到了15%，有如此多的国家没有被影响到，又怎么能说明这条禁令是针对穆斯林的呢。对此珀塞尔引用了特朗普在2016年选举时作出的要禁止穆斯林国家公民出入美国的承诺以及特朗普所在民主党的歧视动机。Flentje辩称珀塞尔试图依据一些新闻的文章阻挠总统的国家安全计划，这是非常奇怪的。</p>

<p>At least two of the judges seemed likely to side with those challenging Mr Trump’s travel ban, and even the third, Mr Clifton, might join a ruling against the government. The only question at this stage is whether to re-impose the executive order pending further proceedings in the Seattle district court. The burden of proof rests on the government to show that such a move is necessary to prevent irreparable harm,and little Mr Flentje said seemed persuasive to the panel. 

So the most likely scenario seems to be that the ban remains on hold, for now—or until the government takes its case to the Supreme Court. Given the 4-4 ideological split on the high court, the on-again, off-again travel rules are likely to remain in limbo. 
</p>
<p>至少有两位法官看起来是站在反对特朗普禁令的一方的，甚至第三个法官也似乎要参与到反对政府执行该禁令的管制当中。现阶段的唯一问题是是否在西雅图地方法院继续暂停禁令。留给政府的责任是证明该行为不会造成不可挽回的损失，对此Flentje的陈述几乎没有说服力。因此目前来说最可能的发展是这个禁令仍然会被暂停，可能要到等到政府上诉至最高法院。由于高级法院的对半分的分歧，这个断断续续的禁令似乎仍然没有重见天日的机会。</p>
