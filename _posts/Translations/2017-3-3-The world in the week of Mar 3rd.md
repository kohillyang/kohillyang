François Fillon, the Republican candidate in France’s presidential election, declared that he will continue his campaign despite being subject to an official criminal investigation over payments he made to his wife and children. Mr Fillon said he had been unfairly singled out by magistrates and implied that the investigation was politically motivated. François Hollande, France’s president, criticised Mr Fillon for questioning the impartiality of the justice system.

In Britain, two by-elections in seats held by the Labour Party highlighted its directionless leadership under Jeremy Corbyn. It lost Copeland, which it had held since 1935, handing the Conservatives the ﬁrst gain at a by-election for a governing party since 1982. It also lost ground in the safer seat of Stoke. Labour is trailing behind the government in polls by nearly 20 points and Mr Corbyn’s personal ratings are on the ﬂoor.

The House of Lords amended the bill in an eﬀort to secure the rights of EU nationals living in Britain.

### How to be presidential
Donald Trump gave his ﬁrst speech to Congress. In a depar- ture from the shrillness that has characterised his presiden- cy so far, a composed Mr Trump gave a solemn address, though the themes of cracking down on illegal immigration, overturning Obamacare and erecting trade barrierssounded familiar. He also pledged his full support for NATO, having previously questioned the value of the military alliance.

### The deluge
Storms in the Andes pushedmud and debris into the riversthat supply Santiago, Chile’s capital, with water. Around 4m people were cut oﬀ from run- ning water. At least three people died and 19 went missing during the storms, whichstruck the country during a normally dry season.ustavito, a much-loved hippopotamus in El Salvador’s national zoo (pictured above in happier times), died after an apparent beating. Investigators have not found the culprits, who sneaked into the zoo and hit the animal with blunt and sharp objects. El Salvador has one of the world’s highest murder rates, but Salvadoreans were espe-cially shocked by this killing.
