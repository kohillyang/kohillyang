Good Morning, honored teachers, I'm Yangkeshan and I'm a student studying control theories in Class Automation 32 in Xi'an JiaoTong University. Last year, I took part in the postgraduate interview and got an pre-admission chance. And after the graduate entrance examination, I'm very proud to have this opportunity to introduce myself. In this introduction I'll cover several key areas, which I do think, are very important in paving the way for researching in the following three years as a graduate student. Theses areas are theories, practice, and communication.

　The first area, theory, which I do think。During the four years in university, I have ever awarded a title of 'outstanding student'. Not only hava I learnt lots of lessons, but also I'm able to take them into practice. For example, after the lesson Analog Electronics, I can make a boost or bulk circuit controlled by microprocessor unit with some closed loop algorithms by myself; After lesson Classics control theory, I can write a program to control a smart car using PID algorithm, and, in fact, it works well. After self-learning of inertial Navigation System, I can control a quadrotor using some modern algorithms like Kalman-filter. and after Digital signal process, I can write a simple ASR sytem using features like MFCC.

　The second area, practice ability, which do I think, is an important tool which can help you speed your research up. And in this area, I can write programs with many language, like Verilog HDL, C-Plus-Plus, Qt, C#, C51, and python. I can write programs for lots of chips, like Freescale K60 series, Atmel avr series, C51 series, and FPGA like xilink x70a series or Altera EP series.  Moreover, in the Item design, I wrote a program to make the camera picture show in an easier way, and I was very glad to see the result that it saved many students' debug time. We have ever honored with the Third Prize for 2016 National Undergraduate Elactronic Design Contest.

　And In the last area, named communication, which also plays a necessary role in researching, I'm the chair of IBM student technology club. I have ever lead my team to gain the third prize in the national undergraduate electronic design contest. Therefore, I'm confident to say that there is no problem in this aspect.

  That's my self-introduction, thank you for your listen.
